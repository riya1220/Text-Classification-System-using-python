Email Spam Detection using NLP classifies emails and SMS as spam or not spam using Machine Learning. It preprocesses text, extracts features with TF-IDF and Word Embeddings, and trains models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and NLTK, it achieves high accuracy and can be improved with LSTMs or BERT.
